this should be a web-app, to calculate your subscriptions and create a donut chart to get an overview how much you're spending in total, for each section, and then for each subscription ofc.

this app should contain all international subscriptions (netflix, spotify, disney+, etc.) and we want also local major subscriptions.

and since international subscriptions have different pricings and models per country we also want to have this included.

we don't need a bunch of subscriptions for now, just 3 per category.

and read the @STYLE_GUIDE.md to use the style. instead of clash just use the satoshi font  in the @/fonts folder.
